October 5 2023: Meeting with Bob and Alice. There was a strong disagreement, since Bob thought that chess is a boring game, while Alice is a big fan. I tried to mediate between the two, let's see how the situation evolves in the following days.

October 6 2023: very good weather, I think I will go running in the evening. No meeting for the day, just a lot of paperwork to do.

October 7 2023: Private meeting with Bob. He is willing to concede that chess is a game rich in strategy. I had a chat with the IT department, they want me to change the password within 10 days. I need to remember to do that.

October 8 2023: I heard from Charlie that Bob and Alice were able to put their differences aside. Maybe the atmosphere in the lunchbreak will finally improve. No more free coffee for breakfast in the office. While it might save some money, I am not sure the move was worth it. It has irritated the employees a lot.

October 9 2023: I haven't yet changed my password, but I will do that later. Very busy right now, I need to prepare for a big presentation coming up on October 11. The weather has turned bad today, and everybody in the office seems a little sadder.

October 10 2023: Alice, Bob and Charlie organized a brainstorming session this morning at 10am. Bob came up with an idea for an AI chatbot that helps motivating you to exercise in a personalized way. Alice expressed some doubts, but I think it might be an interesting idea.

October 11 2023: I had the big presentation, and it was really important to impress Dave. I think I made a good impression, while Eugene remained skeptical of the progress made. He wants to see more practical results. We definitely need to focus more on delivering results in the next couple of weeks.

October 12 2023: The idea of the "Excercise motivator" app is gaining traction in the company, I should remember to give Alice credit for having that idea!

October 13 2023: Have I changed the password yet?
